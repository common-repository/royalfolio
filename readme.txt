A simple and easy to use portfolio plugin with image gallery features.

== Description ==

RoyalFolio is a simple and easy to use WordPress plugin for managing your portfolio.

It allows you to add an unlimited number of portfolio categories and projects. Each project can have 
an image gallery to display your work. Images are sortable using "drag-and-drop". 

The plugin is built on WordPress "core features" like custom post types and taxonomies. It even uses
the WordPress media manager for uploading items.

Multiple shortcodes and a custom widget is available for displaying your latest work in both sidebars
and on single pages / posts. You can have multiple galleries on a single page.

With the "basic CSS styling" option enabled, images expand in a fancy "lightbox" window that allows
navigation between gallery images. All images are responsive.

== Installation ==
